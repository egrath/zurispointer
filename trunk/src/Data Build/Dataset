[Attributes]
Attribute 1=Strength
Attribute 1 Description=How strong you are. This will affect how much weight you can carry before becoming encumbered, as well as what armors you can wear. It will also determine the force behind the swing of your sword or hammer, thus affecting how much damage you do in melee combat. Strength does not affect the damage you'll do with "aiming" weapons like bows, daggers, and spears.
Attribute 2=Constitution
Attribute 2 Description=How healthy you are. Constitution is the basis for your hit points, and how well you resist poison and disease.
Attribute 3=Dexterity
Attribute 3 Description=This is your manual dexterity and how good you are with your hands. This increases your offense roll for all "aiming" weapons like bows, daggers, spears, etc., and will affect all rogue skills such as Sneak, Climb, etc. Evade, Parry and Shield use all gain bonuses from Dexterity.
Attribute 4=Quickness
Attribute 4 Description=This is your reaction time. It will affect how quickly you cast spells and how often you get to swing your weapon.

Attribute 6=Piety
Attribute 6 Description=This is how in tune you are with yourself and the gods, and how likely you are to make a leap of faith in the right direction. It's used to determine the mana and spell effectiveness for Albion and Midgard priests as well as the tribal Midgardian casters, like Runemasters.
Attribute 7=Empathy
Attribute 7 Description=This is how in tune you are with your surroundings, animals, people and the elements etc. It's used to provide mana for Hibernian healers.
Attribute 8=Charisma
Attribute 8 Description=Your character's natural likeability and persuasiveness. This *may* determine selling prices to vendors, as well as NPC reactions. For Bards, Minstrels, and Skalds, Charisma affects how motivational and inspiring (effective) your songs are.
[Realms]
Realm 1=Albion
Realm 1 Description=The Britons are the human inhabitants of Albion, the kingdom that Arthur founded and kept intact for his reign. Now, however, it is starting to decline – especially in the border areas, where constant incursion by enemy raiding parties is becoming common. The Britons are comprised of the common Briton, the tall intelligent Avalonian, the brawny Highlander, and the dexterous Saracen.            Briton magic comes from the study of the arts of elemental magic – the essence of all that is around us. The center of this study is the city of Avalon, which boasts the strongest and most powerful mage guilds.            The Highlanders were driven from their territories north of Camelot by the incessant warfare with the other Realms. They are larger than the other Britons, usually are strong and hardy. The Avalonians are from the mystical city of Avalon, which is the seat of magical study in Albion. Hence, they are of a more magical bent than the other Briton inhabitants. The Saracens are the descendents of Sir Palomides, the dusky Knight from the far southern deserts whose descendents remained in Albion to help further Arthur’s crusade. They are generally quicker and more dexterous than their Briton counterparts.
Realm 2=Hibernia
Realm 2 Description=The emerald green western island of Hibernia is inhabited by the nature-worshipping human Celts. At one time in the island's history, the Celts warred with the primal magic using "Otherworld" elvish creatures that were said to live "under the hill" in fantastical cities. In light of the mutual threat of armed invasion by Norse or Britons, the Otherworld creatures have joined forces with the Celts to form a powerful combination of magic, nature worship, and arms.            The Hibernians are made of the human Celts, who demonstrate a profound affinity with nature. The Elves are beautiful tall, thin, humanoids who specialize in all forms of magical spell casting, and have the ability to bear arms. The almost-giant Firbolg combine nature worship with practical magic and arms skills. The small, quick Lurikeen show an aptitude for both spellcasting as well as dexterous fighting.            Hibernian magic comes from two sources. Their most powerful spells come from the Otherworld Elvish mastery of primal Arcane magic. Other casters also have a variety of nature-based druidic spells. In general, the Hibernians are the most magically-inclined of all the Realms – almost all of their classes support some sort of spell-casting.
Realm 3=Midgard
Realm 3 Description=The Norse hail from the northern kingdom of Midgard, comprising the modern-day region of Scandinavia. They are generally stocky in build, strong, and not quite as civilized as inhabitants of the other Realms. However, when it comes to fighting, the Norse are equaled by none. Traditionally, the races of Midgard do not cooperate fully, but in this time of conquest and danger, they have put aside their differences to fight their common enemies. The Norse races are the human Norseman, the large strong Troll, the short hardy Dwarf, and the small crafty Kobold.            Norse magic comes almost exclusively from their gods – from Odin, Thor, and Hel. Trolls and Kobolds can also choose to become the wild Shaman, a primitive tribal magic user.            The Norseman are the humans of Midgard, and as such are tall, hale, hardy, but generally not as civilized as humans from other Realms. The Trolls are large fearsomely strong creatures who make great fighters. The Dwarves are stocky and wise, making good priests and fighters. The Kobolds are smaller than dwarves, but much quicker and more dexterous, excelling in the arts of hiding and climbing.
